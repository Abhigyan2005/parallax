          The wind howled through the empty plains, carrying dust and echoes of
          the past. The setting sun bled into the horizon, casting long, dying
          shadows over the land. Cade Harlow rode slow, hunched forward in the
          saddle, his grip on the reins weak.

      <p class="story-text upper bg-bl">
        The job had been too easy. A bounty, dead or alive, taken down without
        much trouble.<br />
        The gold was stacked neatly in the saddlebags. cade sat by the fire,
        Clay beside him, drinking from a flask.<br />
        cade: (leaning back, stretching his legs) "Feels good, don’t it? Bein’
        on the right side of luck for once."<br />
        <br />
        Clay: (nodding, smiling, but distant) "Yeah. Good as it gets."<br />
        cade didn’t notice how Clay’s hand tensed on his belt. The sound of
        horses approaching made cade sit up. <br />Then—gunfire. Bullets ripped
        through the quiet night, men shouting in the distance.<br />
        cade scrambled for his gun but felt a sharp pain tear through his
        side.<br />
        He hit the dirt. Through blurry eyes, he saw men in badges—lawmen.<br />
        And standing beside them—Clay.
        <img src="imgs/01/betray2.webp" alt="" />
        <br />
        cade tried to reach for his gun, but Clay stepped forward. Clay:
        (shaking his head, sighing) "Ain’t personal, cade.<br />
        You were worth more alive to me than that bounty."
        <img src="imgs/01/betrayal.webp" alt="" />
        <br />
        cade wanted to laugh, but he could only choke on blood.<br />
        The cops moved in, but cade fought through the pain, grabbed his gun,
        and fired.<br />
        He hit one, then another.<br />
        And then, somehow—he got to Dusty. He rode.<br />
        Hard. Fast.<br />
        Away from the betrayal, away from Clay. But he had already lost too much
        blood.

          cade exhaled slowly, staring at the vast, indifferent sky. The wind
          had quieted, leaving only the sound of Dusty’s slow, steady steps. "A
          man makes choices, and choices make a man," he murmured. Ghosts
          stirred in his memory—faces lost to the years, men who never got to
          fire back. He had told himself it was survival. Now, with blood
          soaking his side, he wasn’t so sure. "How many lives did I steal," he
          whispered, "just ‘cause I was quicker on the draw?" The weight of it
          all settled in his bones. He loosened his grip on the reins, his voice
          barely more than a breath. "Maybe happiness ain’t about what you
          take," he said. "Maybe it’s about what you leave behind." And for the
          first time, he had nothing left to chase.

        Maria’s voice lingered in his mind, softer than the wind but sharper
        than any bullet he had ever taken. <br>He could still see her standing by
        the fire, arms crossed, eyes full of something he never had the courage
        to face. Back then, he had laughed at the idea of quitting. The road had
        called to him, gold glittering just out of reach. <br> He had ridden off
        without looking back, convinced the world owed him more than a quiet
        life. Now, with the weight of years pressing heavy on his chest, he

        the horizon. "Spent my whole life chasin’ things," he thought. <br> *"But in
